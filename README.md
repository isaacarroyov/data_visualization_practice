# Data Visualization Practice: Python

Hello! My name is Isaac Arroyo and as part of my learning path to become a Data Scientist (or something else related to the Artificial Intelligence field/industry) I created this repository. Here you can find _mini-projects_ where I practice my **Data Visualization skills in Python** . In case you're looking for Data Visualization in other languages I invite you to have patience and wait because I'm still learning R and Julia ( _baby steps_ ).

I hope this repo can be useful to some of you, use it as you like it:
* practice,
* inspiration
* help with data visualizations

Join me, we can learn together! 

## Table of contents
This repository is organized by folders (Python's Data Visualization libraries) and inside those folders... there are more folders ( _mini-projects_ where I practice ). In each _library folder_ you can find a Jupyter Notebook with different ways of visualizing data according to the _mini-project_ and (obviously) the **REAMDE.md** file where I write the required software/libraries for each _mini-project_ .

Also there is a **relevant_code** folder and inside there are **.py** files for the plots and visualizations only, so you can try them or modify them in the text editor of your preference (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom).
