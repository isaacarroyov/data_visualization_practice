# Data Visualization Practice
"There is a magic in graphs. The proﬁle of a curve reveals in a ﬂash a whole situation — the life history of an epidemic, a panic, or an era 
of prosperity. The curve informs the mind, awakens the imagination, convinces." - Henry D. Hubbard.

Hello! My name is Isaac Arroyo. Visualizing data is as important as knowing what to do with them. I've been a visual person since I was 
a kid. The people close to me know that I'm one step closer to finishing it when a book has pictures in it. Most science books have any 
visual tool (photographs, charts, plots, diagrams, illustration, etc.), and I think that's why I'm into science (and mostly physics). 
The better we visualize data, the better we can understand the problem and communicate the solution.


As part of my learning path to become a Data Scientist, I created this repository. Here you can find _mini-projects_ where I practice 
my **Data Visualization skills**. Use it as you like 
it:
* practice,
* inspiration
* help with data visualizations

Join me, we can learn together!

## What's in the repository?
I organize this repository by folders (Data Visualization libraries/packages). Inside those folders you can find the _dataviz mini-projects_ 
(where I practice). In each library folder, you can find:

* a Jupyter Notebook, RMarkdown or any other resource for documentation of the process.
* (obviously) the **REAMDE.md** file where I write the required software/libraries for each dataviz mini-project
* Scripts for the visualizations only, so you can try them or modify them in the text editor of your preference.
