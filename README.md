# Data Visualization Practice: Python
"There is a magic in graphs. The proﬁle of a curve reveals in a ﬂash a whole situation — the life history of an epidemic, a panic, or an era of prosperity. The curve informs the mind, awakens the imagination, convinces." - Henry D. Hubbard.

Hello! My name is Isaac Arroyo. To me, visualizing data is as important as knowing what to do with them. I'm a visual person since I was a kid. The people close to me know that I'm one step closer to finish it when a book has pictures in it. Most science books have any visual tool (photographs, charts, plots, diagrams, illustration, etc.), and I think that's why I'm into science (and mostly physics). The better we visualize data, the better we can understand the problem and communicate the solution.


As part of my learning path to become a Data Scientist (or something else related to the Artificial Intelligence field/industry), I created this repository. Here you can find _mini-projects_ where I practice my **Data Visualization skills in Python**. In case you're looking for Data Visualization (or any other kind of visualization tool) in other languages, I invite you to have patience and wait because I'm still learning R and Julia (_baby steps_). I hope this repo can be useful to some of you. Use it as you like it:
* practice,
* inspiration
* help with data visualizations

Join me, we can learn together!
## What's in the repository?
I organize this repository by folders (Python's Data Visualization libraries), and inside those folders are more folders ( the _mini-projects_ where I practice ). In each library folder, you can find:
* a Jupyter Notebook with different ways of visualizing data according to the mini-project
* (obviously) the **REAMDE.md** file where I write the required software/libraries for each mini-project
* And the **.py** files for the plots and visualizations only, so you can try them or modify them in the text editor of your preference (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.)

## Mini-projects
Here you can find the content inside this repository. I'm trying to use as many Python libraries or at least the most relevant ones.  For now, I've been using the following:
* Matplotlib + Seaborn :chart_with_upwards_trend: :bar_chart:: (working on it... :hourglass_flowing_sand:)
* GeoPandas :earth_americas: :world_map: : (working on it... :hourglass_flowing_sand:)
* Altair :eye: : (working on it... :hourglass_flowing_sand:)
* Folium :earth_americas: :world_map::
  * [Visualizing Mexico's wildfire information](https://github.com/isaacarroyov/data_visualization_practice/tree/master/Folium/Wildfires)
