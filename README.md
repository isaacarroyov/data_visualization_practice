# Data Visualization Practice
"There is a magic in graphs. The proﬁle of a curve reveals in a ﬂash a whole situation 
— the life history of an epidemic, a panic, or an era of prosperity. The curve informs 
the mind, awakens the imagination, convinces." - Henry D. Hubbard.

Visualizing data is as important as knowing what to do with them. I've been a visual 
person since I was a kid. The people close to me know that I'm one step closer to 
finishing it when a book has pictures in it. Most science books 
have any visual tool (photographs, charts, plots, diagrams, illustration, etc.), and I 
think that's why I'm into science (and mostly physics). The better we visualize data, 
the better we can understand the problem and communicate the solution.

As part of my learning path to become a Data Scientist, I created this repository. 
Here you can find _mini-projects_ where I practice my **Data Visualization skills**. 
Use it as you like it:
* practice,
* inspiration
* help with data visualizations

Most of the plots are going to be on my Instagram account 
([@unisaacarroyov](https://www.instagram.com/unisaacarroyov/)). Join me, we can learn together!

## What's in the repository?
I organize this repository by folders (Data Visualization libraries/packages). Inside those folders you can find the _dataviz mini-projects_ 
(where I practice). In each library folder, you can find:

* a Jupyter Notebook, RMarkdown or any other resource for documentation of the process.
* (obviously) the **REAMDE.md** file where I write the required software/libraries for each dataviz mini-project
* Scripts for the visualizations only, so you can try them or modify them in the text editor of your preference.
