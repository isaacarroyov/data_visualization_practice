# Data Visualization Practice
"There is a magic in graphs. The proﬁle of a curve reveals in a ﬂash a whole situation 
— the life history of an epidemic, a panic, or an era of prosperity. The curve informs 
the mind, awakens the imagination, convinces." - Henry D. Hubbard.

Visualizing data is as important as knowing what to do with them. I've been a visual 
person since I was a kid. The people close to me know that I'm one step closer to 
finishing it when a book has pictures in it. Most science books 
have any visual tool (photographs, charts, plots, diagrams, illustration, etc.), and I 
think that's why I'm into science (and mostly physics). The better we visualize data, 
the better we can understand the problem and communicate the solution.

To me, Data Visualization is like telling a story. Consequently, I treat my projects with 
patience and dedication, like a scientist writting a research paper.

Here you can find _mini-projects_ where I practice my **Data Visualization skills**. 
Use it as you like it:
* practice,
* inspiration
* help with data visualizations

Most of the plots are going to be on my Instagram account

## What's in the repository?
I organized this repository the following way:
> * :open_file_folder: **Folders** :arrow_right: Data Visualization tool (programming language or software)
>   * (_inside_) :open_file_folder: **Folders** :arrow_right: Data visualization projects (name)
>     * (_inside_) :books: **Resources** :arrow_right: the final charts (a folder named **images**), the code and external links (not all the times).
