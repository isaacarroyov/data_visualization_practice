## Wildfires in Mexico

No record found yet implies wildfires are a natural disaster, at least not in Mexico; nevertheless, the theUnited States Environmental Protection Agency classifies wildfires as one. Interestingly, human beings cause about 90% of wildfires and nature 10% [(Wolters,2020)](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/natural-disasters/wildfires/)

In my state, Yucatán, the number of lost vegetation by wildfires is enormous. Just in the first five months of 2020, seventeen wildfires occurred, and they consumed around 8 thousand hectares of land. Yucatán was in the top ten in the category of "Biggest affected states" and second place in "Damaged sensitive material."

## Bachelor's Thesis

Currently (March 2020), I'm starting to work on my bachelor's thesis to predict wildfires in a region of Yucatán. Like any other research, I first had to see the bigger picture of Mexico's wildfire situation. I encountered a dataset that gives me information about the recorded wildfires in Mexico during 2017, so I decided to explore the data and found out the following way of visualizing it.

## Objective

I wanted to do a tutorial because I think this could help other people that perhaps are in the same situation as me. I hope you find it valuable.

There are more tools inside **folium** that will be covered another time.
