# Data Visualization Practice: `folium`

## Importance of geospatial data

When we see a fair amount of data related to our city, country or the whole world, we want to know how it looks on a map. Why? It is the primary mode of showing geospatial data.

If we want to do great work exploring and communicating the geospatial data, we need a fast and easy-to-use tool, at least when you are a beginner, and here is where **`folium`** comes into the field.

## What is folium?

According to the official webpage:

"**`folium`** builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the **`leaflet.js`** library. Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it in on a **Leaflet map** via **`folium`**."

**`folium`** makes it easy to take data manipulated in Python into an interactive map. You can pass rich vector/raster/HTML visualization as markers on the map.

The library has several built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen and supports custom tilesets with Mapbox or Cloudmade API keys. Folium supports both Image, Video, GeoJSON and TopoJSON overlays.

## Installation

You can install folium with both **`pip`**:

```
pip install folium
```

or **`conda`**:

```
conda install folium -c conda-forge
