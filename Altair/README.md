## Visualizing Spotify
### The 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1
Thanks to the marketing campaing **Spotify's Wrapped**, many of us share a summary of what we've been listening 
to throughout the year. Just like every **summary**, there's **data** in the process in the making. Here, I'm 
presenting you a **visual summary** of some of **my Spotify's Wrapped playlists**

## Visualizing temperatures 02 (Working on it... :hourglass_flowing_sand:)
This work is made to compare the outputs of similar plots made with different libraries and programming languages.
In the meantime, check out the first plot made with **R** [here](https://github.com/isaacarroyov/data_visualization_practice/tree/master/R#visualizing-temperatures-01)
